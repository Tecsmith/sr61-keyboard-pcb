### PCB delivered

- Arrived in Sydney via DHL.  No issues.

### Initial testing

- Soldered on UBS connector
- Soldered on MicroMod connector
- Installed SMT32 module and Tested key matrix - ***IT WORKS!***
  - Must say I build 2 boards and both didn't work at first - fault finding lead to discovery that one of the USB data lines was grounded.  On one board I stripped out the ESD thinking that was up-side-down... it wasn't.  And then I found it.  A solder short on the MicroMod connector between pin 5 and 7... on BOTH!
  - Must also say the soldering that Micromod connector was super difficult!
  - Next time I will have all the components installed by the supplier!
- PCBWay did an amazing job on the PCB!

### Declaring Rev A as FAILED :(

Came across some terminal issues when compiling the code and attempting to retro-fit the PCB into a AnnePro2 case.

- The `ESC` key is off to right by 1mm.  Checked the CAD `.sch` and say that somehow I'd moved it and missed that it was off by 1mm.  Must have been on the rotation and I didn't double check.
- The LED implementation does not work electronically.  Somewhere between the MCU the Level Shifter and the first LED something happens and I blow the 1st LED.  Soldered on 3 replacements, all blown. Bypass the `Caps-Lock` position and made `5` key 1st - that blew to.  Need to relook at more ref. designs for this.

#### Next

- Everything else seems to work.  Code also works...
- ... but I'd assumed the memory IC on the MicroMod was an EEPROM. **It's not** .. it's Flash! *(Rookie assumption!)*  Will implement an I²C EEPROM as the 100,000 write cycles of the W25Q32FV Flash is far, far less than the 4,000,000 of an external EEPROM like the ST M24Cx IC's.
> Wondering what I can do with the Flash tho ... seems a waste.

# Rev A - Issues
> as discovered ... to implement in rev. B

- [ ] ~~Position of MicroMod connector is too low, does not fit in AP2 case without minor cutting - possibly move this up as far as it can go.~~ *[Cannot move as it will interfere with key]*
- [x] Position of the BOOT pads in the space bar area should align to the AP2 slot
- [x]  Spacing of key was generated by [Kalerator](https://kalerator.clueboard.co/) ... but this generator spaces the keys at 19mm.  **However***... spacing for keyboards is **19.05mm**!

#### Post FAIL / Rev B WIP

- [x] Correct `ESC` key position
- [x] New LED / Level Shift design
- [ ] ~~Bring out I²C from Micromod~~ *[I²C not usable as pins are shared with matrix pins for PR2040 module]*
- [x] ~~Add I²C EEPROM module~~ *[Changed this to SPI]*
- [x] Move USB 0.5mm right to align to AP2 case slot. *(Uncertain this will jeopardise the GH60 cases.)*

## Maybe

- [x] Move 5678 LED's to north-facing.
- [x] Possibly incorporate a ISO layout?
- [ ] ~~Possibly incorporate a 64-key layout?~~ *[Does not fit]*

> Rev B is ready *[26 Aug 2022]*
