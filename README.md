## Features

**SR61-MicroMod** - using SparkFun MicroMod STM32 or RP2040 M.2 module

### Core Design Elements

- 60% form factor
    - Design to be compatible with GH60/HK60 cases
    - Also compatible with Anne Pro 2 cases *(~~drop in~~ QMK replacement for existing AP2's or AP2 cases)* *[Removal of battery and minor case cut in the battery compartment required.]*
    - MicroMod positioned in case *"battery compartment"* space.

- QMK + VIA default f/w
    - Wired only *(no wireless)*
    - Default key-maps for Mac users

- User choice of microcontroller
    
    - [STM32 Processor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17713) 
        - ARM Cortex-M4, 168MHz, 1MB Flash, 192kB SRAM
        - https://github.com/Tecsmith/sr61-keyboard-qmk

    - [RP2040 Processor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17720) 
        - ARM Cortex-M0+, 133MHz, 128Mb Flash (16MB external), 264kB SRAM in six banks
        
- USB-C *(left side)*

    ... but also optional JST connector for [ai03 Unified C3 Daughterboard](https://github.com/ai03-2725/Unified-Daughterboard)

- ESD, Over Voltage and Over Current protection

    ... and cable shield noise filter

- Hot-swap, 5 pin switch slots

- PCB mounted stabs compatibility

- Dual ANSI / ISO layout support

- 61-Key (ANSI) / 62-Key (ISO) Layout [1.25, 1.25, 1.25, **6.25**, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25] bottom row *(a.k.a. "Poker" / "POK3R" Layout)*

- Limited RGB LEDs *(SK6812 mini-E)*

    - RGB Caps Lock Indicator

    - North facing RGB's under the `5`, `6`, `7` & `8` keys for layer indicator

    - WS2812/SK6812 breakout for optional external LEDs

- Spare GPIO pins (`52` & `63`) breakout for expansion

   ... e.g., ~~add speaker~~

- Both `[Reset]` and `[Boot]` buttons *(as per MicroMod ref. design)*

    ... plus under space-bar Boot pins for bootload without disassembly *(press while inserting cable for bootloader function)*
